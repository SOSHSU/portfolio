I feel exhausted in the school, becasue I take a lot of advanced placement courses to enrich my transcript. I have a father, mother, brother and sister in my family. This is my first Portfolio Website in web developemnt. I hope you enjoy it. Today, I am continue doing this website. I have done most of the college applications, and I only have 2 more days to finish this projects before the end of this semester. I hope I can survive! Whatever, hope you enjoy viewing my portfolio.</p>

                    <h4>Mathematics</h4>
                    <p class = "math">When most people first think of the term mathematics or the word "Algebra," they don't get too excited. Most people tend to say "I hate math!" or the big one, "When are we ever going to use it in our lives." The fact is that algebra will be used in our lives whether we know it or not. For instance, if we were to attend a football game all it is, is one big math problem. In football mathematics can be used in a variety of different ways. It can be used in the game itself, the business portion (ticket sales), or the building of the stadium. Without math the world would not be the same as we know it to be today.
                        One way that we can apply math or algebra to the game of football is trying to find out the revenue collected by ticket sales. Without the use of algebra a football team owner couldn't accurately calculate incoming revenues. Most likely he would be losing more money then he would be making. A professional football team is based on a salary cap. There is billions of dollars invested in the sport and the money needs to be keeping track of.
                        Another way that algebra could be used in the game of football is trying to find the total gain or loss of yards made by the players. This is good for player stats as well as game stats. In football you can use algebra to try and determine how much further you have to go to score or attempt a field goal. These can be major factors in a very close game to plan out a good strategy. This game is basically about skill and strategy and math can be a tool that can lead to success in both areas.
                        The more major part in football that can use math is the building of the stadium. To build a good stadium for fans to be entertained you must have perfect calculations. More importantly is the safety of the people. If an engineer just threw a football stadium together, chances are is that it won't be safe for not only fans but the players as well. </p>

                    <h4>Computer Science</h4>
                    <p class = "cs">Computer science is one of the fastest growing career fields in modern 
                    history. Dating back only a few decades to the late 1950s and early 1960s, it 
                    has become one of the leading industries in the world today. Developed 
                    through the technological architecture of electrical engineering and the 
                    computational language of mathematics, the science of computer technology 
                    has provided considerable recognition and financial gain for many of its well 
                    deserving pioneers. Originally conceived as an organizational solution to the 
                    massive amounts of information kept on nothing more than paper, computers 
                    have evolved and advanced to become a common part of modern day life. In 
                    the early days of the computers age, the newest and most complex 
                    computers took up no less than an entire building or very large room.</p>

                <h4>Statistics</h4>
                <p class = "stats">Whether or not people notice the importance of statistics, people is using them in their everyday life. Statistics have been more and more important for different cohorts of people from a farmer to an academician and a politician. For example, Cambodian famers produce an average of three tons or rice per hectare, about eighty per cent of Cambodian population is a farmer, at least two million people support party A, and so on. According to the University of Melbourne, statistics are about to make conclusive estimates about the present or to predict the future (The University of Melbourne, 2009). Because of their significance, statistics are used for different purposes. Statistics are not always trustable, yet they depend on their reliable factors such as sample, data collection methods and sources of data. This essay will discuss how people can use statistics to present facts or to delude others. Then, it will discuss some of the criteria for a reliable statistic interpretation.

                    <p class = "robotics">First, the industrial robot has help changed the industrial workplace. Thousands of companies depend on the output and quality performance offered by the current industrial robots. Industrial robotics has emerged as a popular manufacturing methodology in several areas in recent years, including welding, materials transport, assembly, and spray finishing operations. The use of industrial robots has helped to increase productivity rate, efficiency and quality of distribution. Industrial robots have significantly changed factories and businesses all over the world. Today’s industrial robot provides companies with a lot of advantages. These robots alone have changed products production and the industrial work place.

                    Improved technologies have made the industrial robots easy to use, inexpensive, and smarter than ever before. The industrial robots can perform jobs with precision, speed, and reliability. The industrial robots have enhanced product quality and improved industrial operations with increase output of products. Having these robots keep workers from having to tolerate boring, dangerous or exhausting jobs. Robotics is an increasingly visible and important component of modern business, especially in certain industries. Robotics-oriented production processes are most obvious in factories and manufacturing facilities; in fact, approximately 90 percent of all robots in operation today can be found in such facilities. These robots, termed “industrial robots,” were found almost exclusively in automobile manufacturing plants 20 years ago. But industrial robots are now being used in laboratories, research and development facilities, warehouses, hospitals, energy-oriented industries (petroleum, nuclear power, etc.), and, above all, in research.
